I always needed time on my own.

忆往日，歆羡闲云，

I never thought I'd need you there when I cry.

美景佳期竟不识。

And the days feel like years when I'm alone.

叹如今，花落数年，

And the bed where you lie is made up on your side.

山犹有木木无枝。

When you walk away,I count the steps that you take.

已别沧海，山云纵相似。

Do you see how much I need you right now?

遥寄锦书，安知雁回时？

When you're gone,the pieces of my heart are missing you.

与君别，寤寐尽相思；

When you're gone,the face I came to know is missing too.

与君别，但念君容饰；

When you're gone,the words I need to hear to always get me through the day and make it OK.

与君别，曼语萦耳伴终日，

I miss you.

却无言，唯相思。


I've never felt this way before.

不曾记，此间仓皇，

Everything that I do reminds me of you.

沅芷澧兰曾相识。

And the clothes you left,they lie on the floor.

犹可见，玉簪青衫，

And they smell just like you,I love the things that you do.

彤管炜美缘君施。

When you walk away,I count the steps that you take.

已别沧海，山云纵相似。

Do you see how much I need you right now?

遥寄锦书，安知雁回时？

When you're gone,the pieces of my heart are missing you.

与君别，寤寐尽相思；

When you're gone,the face I came to know is missing too.

与君别，但念君容饰；

When you're gone,the words I need to hear to always get me through the day and make it OK.

与君别，曼语萦耳伴终日，

I miss you.

却无言，唯相思。
    
We were made for each other,out here forever.

我本与君知，长命无绝衰。

I know we were,yeah!

是然，定然！

All I ever wanted was for you to know,everything I do, I'd give my heart and soul.

我欲与君知，诸事已尽心。

I can hardly breathe I need to feel you here with me, yeah!

仍悲，仍哀！

When you're gone,the pieces of my heart are missing you.

与君别，寤寐尽相思；

When you're gone,the face I came to know is missing too.

与君别，但念君容饰；

When you're gone,the words I need to hear to always get me through the day and make it OK.

与君别，曼语萦耳伴终日，

I miss you.

却无言，唯相思。
